# League of Legends LLM Analysis

## Introduction
League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with a competitive scene that draws millions of viewers. Understanding gameplay at a detailed level can be challenging, especially for players looking to improve their skills. This project aims to simplify this process by leveraging a language model to analyze and summarize gameplay from YouTube videos.

## Project Overview
The system provides users with a detailed summary of a League of Legends game. By inputting a YouTube video URL, users receive a breakdown of key moments, highlights, and suggestions for improvement based on the match content.

### Key Features:
1. **YouTube API Integration**: Automatically retrieves the transcript of a given YouTube video.
2. **GPT-4 Integration**: Uses an advanced language model to generate insightful summaries and actionable feedback.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple input field for users to provide the YouTube URL, with immediate summarized output.

## Workflow

### 1. Input URL
The user inputs the URL of a League of Legends gameplay video.

### 2. URL Processing
- **Clean the URL**: Extract the video ID from the provided URL.
- **Verify Validity**: Ensure the video is accessible and contains a transcript.

### 3. Transcript Retrieval
- Utilize the YouTube API to fetch the video transcript.
- Handle errors such as missing or unavailable transcripts.

### 4. Summarization
- Feed the retrieved transcript into GPT-4 with a well-defined prompt.
- The prompt guides the language model to:
  - Highlight key gameplay moments.
  - Identify areas for improvement.
  - Provide a concise summary tailored to League of Legends.

### 5. Output Summary
- The system generates a clean, detailed summary that the user can immediately view.


## Technical Implementation
### Languages and Tools Used:
- **Python**: Backend development and API handling.
- **YouTube API**: Transcript retrieval.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: Language model integration.
- **Gradio**: Simple and interactive web interface for user interaction.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Unavailable Transcripts**: Implemented fallback mechanisms to inform users when a transcript is missing.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Iterated on prompts to ensure concise and relevant output from GPT-4.
