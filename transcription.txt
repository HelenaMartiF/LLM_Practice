even if he steals the chaos storm it works well with the Real Steal the Nar ultimate works well with Real Steal the silus or steal the scarner ultimate with silus uh and impale with the real Ultimate I feel like it empowers bdd in a really cool way will also gives duck a pretty stable laning phase was more of a niche support looking really good right now um grasp by the way for Faker and Doran as we have engage oh crash down does come in but that is a heroic charge and a first blood for smash way not sure about that one maybe he should have listened to Casting um as that is not going very well and already smash off to a pretty good start grabs himself a feet of strength uh prior to 3 minutes bdd or at least make sure that bdd can get something done as owner is going to have his back denied this could be a big deal as Vault breaker does come in flashes in front to make sure the owner can't get out as BD is going to flash in lands the chains and picks up his first kill but fake is going to immediately answer now you've got a re coming over another Vault breaker going to land there's the down but it's going to get the flash out from fer and he will survive loock him down if he's just a little bit faster there different story oh and doran's going to solo kill perfect onto the turret just one of them is yeah it looks like he just whittel him down earlier it's level six off the last minion and has his mear does the Unstoppable get used he just gets not into the wall wallet it doesn't crush doesn't get to Unstoppable his way out of that one huh yeah sometimes he get chain CC and uh yeah all right cuz's going to be looking for the first dragon perfect will be able to grab one of these grubs as well up T's way and it may come up even more KT can't be playing too aggressively here as Doom isn't going to find the ulti there's another heroic charge and way I mean he did have the uh Aftershock this time but it wore off and then he died hail and stuff like that I'm mostly concerned for T1 the one thing I'm worried about is what bdd can get done with the silus and his steals well there's a storm available and there is the ceas and assist cuz not going to let him live this time and bdd is able to finish that off this his flash came off cool down like 2 seconds after he uh he died there first quarter of their second feet of strength sandals being put together quite nicely yeah and this was utilizing their bot pry very well sandals sandals are incoming you know incoming uh that is going to be five so there we go and T1 have a lot more pushing power as well as uh getting very very close to having new shoes which is pretty nice the lead here for T1 he just have so many tools here in this uh this mid game oner can just press this button over and over again and dock he had flash guys and he uses barrier and dies Bo but he unfortunately did not I think flashing this sit is dead there's an impale God and we's going to have to flash he does manage to do so as at least they do manage to get some damage onto carrier assist as another crash is going to come through cuz is dead he didn't ban SC guys as all right let's see what BD can do diving towards smash here as best he can gets a Killer Instinct but he's dead we's dead Faker is in there they're going to take down the turret it's a catastrophe what is going on see you in game two all I can say um that was almost really cool right duom almost got out without using his flash almost stacked together up being a whole lot of zero actually only counts if you can succeed and that's another turret down yep they got the strong shoes as well uh from that mid lane out of turret falling down then they would have got another one Herald fight I think KT feel like they have to okay this is oh dear is coming in we is going to stop him they're going to see whether they can kill Doran he gets the mean don't know about the flash but it's going to do its job as we is just dead once again perfect and Faker are fighting the gante doing some work here as they take down the stus owner is deciding where he wants to drive and you can see up here nothing going to come of that battle it's looking real good as dock D all right lying in weight wanting to get the chains of corruption he hits it on the scanner and then gets impaled and now he's dead and the scanner did he notice I'm not entirely sure another heroic charge coming on through here on C decent crash down though as carrier may be falling but not before wayy goes down it's a double kill for this scanner look I don't know whether the win rate of scanner is going to be changing to believe you as let's see maybe KT can surprise us they definitely surprise smash right there chains of corruption connect and do arm going to be able to grab the kill that is a shutdown and that is a fair bit of money going into the right hands here has a definable KDA to start us off it's great to see CU speak great to see actually looking for an opportunity towards his bottom side as all out going to be used Doran actually still getting a lot of work done as the Vault breaker is avoided Faker teleports in perfect in a little bit of trouble chains connect though from bdd they take down the Nar and now T1 with a few on the floor this is the best way to beat scanner it's fight them when the scanner isn't there just focus on the cast I know like anyone here in Lark could could just cease and assist me at any point especially G I'm I'm always actually wary of it um I'm always on edge I'm I'm glad that we've now vocalized it it might help me deal if I try to take down as the rift Herald is going to try and get some value because it was almost dead before Shell's charge even came through carrier actually going to save Shell's life at least for a moment they do manage to SC it but is it too late and I think the answer is yes because if you commit to this and it doesn't work out it's a disaster as the keep's verdict is going to be stolen here by bdd and uh that's all they really managed to do but now the teleport is coming in Faker that is a flank angle if ever I've seen one The All Out means he goes even further cu's going to join in but he goes golden he breaks the arm guard and he will be sent back home home of course not really punished all that much we is likely to die here as owner is going to crash him into the wall and yeah he'll crash down but he is certainly still out and KT they lose one could have been worse perhaps Ang bdds hijack back where's doran's position he's got the door maybe oh dear inter corruption is going to stop owner for now they're focusing the scar and actually doing a fair bit of damage here as Doom we're going to try and still get these Autos in carrier Dives forward playing pretty good defense but so is perfect able to knock him back KT surviving for what feels like such a long time and ceas assist is still up and available smash is he going to do it that killer int dives into the backline the magnet stor the immediate reaction and BD smashes him into the wall it is still Aon buff that's available so T1 can pretty happily do this as carrier managing to survive for way too long they take the 100 gold from him but they lose their varis and their BD the chain lash comes in he Dodges the Boulder and the chains are not quite long enough oh T1 can now move back towards the baron and get to work on it it felt like a hype situation from yesterday but it wasn't because smash had outon buff so now he's back he's here to help assist with this Baron and cuz is dead that is going to be a guarantee on that one they've got a cloud Soul if they'd like it to immediately follow up and it will be a 10,000 gold lead you know how we've had these kind of Graphics come up sometimes to talk about like oh it's one the First time we' seen this Champion while some L give some information that the people might not be aware like and now they're even not able to sweep this ward in the tri Rush which is giving T1 all the information that they will ever need and keep his verdict going to miss this time around as cuz will find Faker in the backline but uh then he will be found by owner as well so CZ is very dead that's going to be the first one to go down as Dock's trying to get some Autos in but he's just dead not a lot of opportunity to do anything The Flash doesn't quite work he wanted to get over that wall and perfect is going to act s to his request and then uh that might just be all the positive news here for KT as perfect will be knocked down and T1 with most of KT now on the floor they should be able to walk up and finish this one off already the teleport's coming in Faker he is done with this game he really is and I think you and I have been for about 15 minutes oh wait sorry 28 minutes and 17 seconds wolf that's about it wait when was scar locked in um probably about yeah 30 minutes AG something like that yeah this Champion is very very strong but T1 also playing exceptionally well KT not quite able to make this composition work they will throw some buttons down now but their Nexus will not be saved because especially like when Ari thinks she's like oh I'm just going to go up proc electrocute be careful you watch out you end up getting caught by that Gallo he combos you at level three um he has that magic resistance built up into his kit bdd on the other hand is going to come up here they have a really nice setup here for grubs now way also on the plank and T1 need to be really respectful your fake can ult in but it's a risky call yeah honey fruit going to be eaten here by bdd as cuz will be able to take down the first grub can actually just back away now if they would like to but instead they're going to pull it out perfect going to just shock blast the wave see what he can get done here as the grandmas is might now available here for Doran perfect as keeping KT in this game man his control the Top Lane his push back on Smash there the group that they have with cuz coming up there super fast to the grubs means it's really difficult for T1 to enter and even with jinx uh you know not having a ton of money KT are able to get the first objective on lock here alongside F it's going to be a difficult time however if T1 just have full control of the area they have a lot of range they have a lot of poke and that could be their Avenue to success that's what I'm really thinking is going to be what this game looks like based on what we've seen so far but being 30 CS behind as anyone who's played solo qu with the support that's trolling you as an 0 carry as a side lane threat we does have flash should be okay here he's not even going to take that much damage to the clips but oh my God that is so much poke trash kills him all right well I thought I Caster that's what happens when you get hit by everything by the way ladies and gentlemen great true shot barrage from him the thing about this situation I was going to mention going to the Jack and all that before we really overextended there is you know if they get four five the Jax is significantly weaker as a side lane threat cuz he doesn't have those grubs in his pocket he's down on CS but now they're even in rubs oh dear and I mean dck is not in the safe place well ino's way he's trying to get revenge as BD is Dashing forward super mega Death tget doesn't do anything but that does not matter they still answer the death of way with a kill on Carrier support for support this feed of strength okay this is a really really scary position though for for KT rollster if they lose this fight decisively I mean they they might not have a way back in this game yeah FAS teleport just about to come back up again as Wy goes in finds the solar play superm Death rocket Landing his carrier so incredibly Doran no option cannot do anything and there goes the Drake as well it's beautifully played here for KT to make sure that they deny those Feats of Strength turret still here oh it's going to be a race though let's see how quickly perect can take this down smash just needs another one and it's not going to win that was the first turret going over to KT so once again it's just whoever gets the next objective do not want tagged by a spear or by the true shop barrage as now Doran looking for that angle they poke shell in the eye let's see whether they do manage to lock this one down that's the seal from oner that gets them the Feats of Strength but can they win the team fight Doran already going to go down Doom getting excited and the essence is picked up by bdd throws the orb of deception through and it looks like KT just wanted to get out of there but Faker says no dock d goes down and BD has to flash to get out of the way Spirit fire going to give him that extra movement speed he gets himself out of there and they just can't really have that same was this time he's isolated oh God and he's by himself like why why are we doing this he does manage to get some CC onto smash who may not have wanted to go this far forward but Faker is there to protect him owner in the backline cuz almost kills him finally does manage to take that's a solo kill that's kind of insane where is smash going this fight is all over the place but dock is the one that's truly isolated and perfect does not find the shock blast um yeah okay it almost looked okay for KT but one really turned that one around and it should be a freak Dragon for them perfect from pushing this one up looks like cuz is going to be able to get this uh infernal Drake without too much hassle and it's adakan towards the top side of the map that might be the option here as far as a trade for T1 or maybe catching dock in transition TOP turret is an opportunity for BD Dives on top of Ona Sol of flare is going to stun him up there as well he gets heals but it's not going to be enough and now CU Warrior tricks toova looks for the Cyclone gets the knock off super mega death rocket connects smash gets over the wall though and that shock blast does not land they may need to take a consolation carrier and there it is cuz going to be out to knock down that kill and with two dead one of them being the jungler it may be time to grab themselves an utan as this Traw barrage is going to soften them up momentarily teleport in to stop Doran from just destroying their house BD wants to remove the minion wave but it's not going to be enough actually that turret is going to die the true shot barage from Smash is actually super valuable here I mean these health bars are so low Doran wants to come in and contest they may have an angle Faker has TP as well yeah the heroic entrance going to be there without that Smite it could be a dangerous one dock with the DPS and cuz almost just dead to utan but no they're going to be able to take it down now with that buff it's going to be difficult for Doran to really do too much and he is just going to catch the wave the rest of KT going to back away uh very very difficult here we'll see what they can get because is going in yeah he's going in and he may as well he does have the Aon buff and they're going to take down carrier so it's already worth it I guess spe dashing around gets a bit of extra Essence by helping take down the support doing Aon as uh really want to watch live cuz this is really important they CU getting the double Cyclone here as Doran with that Counter Strike just standing vigil but he's not going to save owner perfect going down very low cuz as well is in trouble and wait never mind he's actually going to be okay Warrior trickst to comes through and remember they have the Aon buff so he's playing with Reckless abandon wayy going in dock Dom is probably pretty dead at point in time yeah it's going to be dor help blocking that one down pryed hey there we go but also still gives away a little bit of gold as BD I mean q the the Yaky sacks as he's underneath the enemy turret looking to see whether he can take down smash he's not going to be able to charm from Beyond the Grave comes on through there and now going to defend this inner turret so Faker here on this bottom side outers and iners is going to be just free money here for T1 who have really rid the map of these structures and and smash has done so much damage yeah he's uh really making things work for him do not and uh this is really like again KT walking a fine line here on this Dragon yeah cuz already getting it so incredibly low as owner out of vision right now Faker actually engaging onto way not really the priority Target there's a cyclone into the backline baker gets interrupted no heroic charge for him has now smash might have his first death of the series but no heak shifts away keeps himself alive it is going to be Soul point for KT they kill owner it is probably still a great trade for them but the fact that smash survives that's sick and Doran trying to get on in here as Doom able to get the flame trumpers down Lea strike to avoid them Doom gets taunted but he does have the barrier can he get himself alive the answer is no and there is the knock up on the C as well Warrior trickster comes in he gets oh my goodness the Cinders to keep him alive as oh Doran you didn't want to take that one as the turret is going to finish him off yeah all the oh even gets the C he's dead yeah uh because yeah smash just chases him down has the extra movement speed from the Inspire and it is so doomed like this is this should be just Baron this time wait you're not supposed to go in nobody's there you're not supposed to just go back in but dark time you're not allowed to be there because smash just chases you down you die everybody knows exactly like literally every person who's played more than 10 games of League of Legends knows exactly that feeling where you're like I zap that and I think it'll be okay like I think I can get that like hold on let me zap that Cannon and I need this money I'm so desperate I haven't been able to farm all game it's not fair I mean we maybe we're being Hasty yeah I don't think we're being too hasty having this discussion as Faker is going to get caught out momentarily going to get stopped by those F flame chump is is way is dead but can they kill Faker the Cyclone comes in and yes they can carrier to go down as well and the resets are starting to come through bdd does need to be careful because smash oh he gets Charmed and he immediately just Arcane shift cleanses gets out do almost just dies to that true shot barrage and remember there's a man Advantage for KT but it doesn't feel like it because smash is here and he's looking to just take matters into his own hands Doran going golden at about zero Health the zaps are connecting you have to kill smash KT you have to kill him otherwise he will kill all of you as perfect gets on top of him there's the shutdown and KT they lose no one and it's an Ace and that's infernal Soul maybe we we Hasty at every time you doubt KT every time it's a unanimous prediction against him but smash disadvantage KD don't have that guy but still even he oh dear teleported in as well that Tower is not long for the world and they lose the goat at the same time perfect is dealing with this but what is going on they're 131 and they're taking everything on the map they have a gold lead out of nowhere they have a dragon soul I'm excited too do I don't blame you blink and suddenly KT roller bringing you the game like feels like but we're not there yet but I mean what play around a baron start and now they just have full pryo entirely so now that engage Bally they're running at Doom who is once again taking too much damage that is another true barrage he just walks too slow ladies and gentlemen now KT trying to make up for it carrier going to go down owner goes golden but it does not save him and everyone's just in the KT blender CU looking for it taking matters into his own hands gets the extended range on the que and smash goes down Doran is tank Jacks I don't know what he's supposed to really do here he goes golden a little bit and then BD takes him down and Faker is running for the hills now KT going to get the bar they can now use the baron maybe wait 4 seconds but now they can use the baron to take an elder KT really in favor and if they kill CU here that is actually kind of huge they spot Faker here for a moment Doran Dives in on top of perfect but he taxes himself out using the gallo and Doran is now going to pay the price nice oh T1 that may have been a game losing play because the Elder Dragon just came up fake is able to get out but it's a four versus five all right KT going to have to make the call they still have Baron I think this pushing rather than Elder is definitely the way yeah not wanting to take the risk here but it does give them an opportunity is oh B makes the play catches carrier and the zap almost lands smash able to create the distance over Faker is dead and way is now pushing forward KT not risking this elder buff at all and it is only smash Left Alive I don't think he's going to be able to do it he takes down way at least he gets that one but it is three games it was always going to be three games Gap closer whatever the opposite weirding it's going to give her some distance right where she can play around him really well and in team fights and then side Lanes the Swain is is constantly going to be a potential uh collapse Target how bad of a position this is and also a never move is going to land here on the faker as well level one this way oh yeah way going to have to flash that one oh no it's game one all over again unacceptable absolute disaster like that's a face palm the rule yes uh as his Austin Powers I I think also to to a certain extent but it's a little bit different as okay smash diving on forward carrier is going to look for dockon doesn't quite get a good flash out but they do manage to get the Summoner spell in trade for just carrier's two Summoner spells cu's going to be taking down this Dragon though as the grubs are collected on the top side so it's a trade of grubs for Dragon but also they have this dive set up here potentially with owner no wave though just yet so it's going to be enough time to crash or before this crashes for them to get away but means they're going to lose Farm bdd wants to come over here and make an impact I just oh okay well way is going to get back to the Tet because do arm he can teleport in they do manage to claim themselves a plate as's we now wanting to cancel his back as the GS do spawn means he won't be able to reset in time to get over here if they do want to fight this equalizer could be important as wind becomes lightning not going to connect neither does it never move but the hook is going to be there they do get on top of carrier who does get the quickness off smash taking a lot of damage Grand Starfall does bring him in the demon flare available for V is cuz staying alive for so long doesn't have Flash though so he is going to die B just trying to do his best to get a kill anywhere and it straight up doesn't work that was a complete collapse from KT and T1 should be able to grab themselves some extra grubs making it look like he's made a mistake and he actually sets up with the the fake out into the re-engage there from owner so beautifully pops his ult as well even going to get a demolish proc on the mid turret then go with his lovers duel back to base area you know he's he's definitely feeling very good about himself here in this third and final game it's it's just bugged cuz they have two fats of strength right on the objectives all right yeah so they have to have got over they to go that's the the two that they managed to get this is going to be Feats of Strength if they do manage to secure this uh KT have information Mega Inferno bomb could actually just be thrown in to see whether he can steal it away but they don't have the information there it goes dock was waiting for it but uh waiting a little bit too long he just juggling yeah maybe this is the time right like aiiz is complete like BD has got some utility really does need LeAndre is in a bit of extra damage before he's really a threat um but he's in the Top Lane Baker is moving down T1 just have so much damage if they do decide to turn and they have decided to turn in comes Doran looking for that equalizer angle as public execution as they dive in on top of Faker can they actually kill him though the answer is yes but they'll lose their Nautilus for it cuz has that Crescent guard bdd just trying to get this demon flare to do some more damage it does do a fair bit off the back end as cuz locks down the rift Herald and that was a better fight for KT yeah that was you know you can start to see some of the Swain value in those types of extended exchanges fight we'll be able to stop this back as well oh maybe flashing on top of for bdd the never move does connect but he doesn't want to bring him closer there's the Sith lightning and BD grabs the solo or Doran dies and uh dark's got flash a little bit safer he's going to clear this wave out yeah does get some shoes together as well his Merk Treads are allow allowing him to book it down towards this dragon fight do D and way in the banana brush we know banana brush controls so incredibly powerful owner wants to ult the back line but wants to stay close to the dragon so he can secure that Smite yeah there's the never move as Faker takes the turret on the top side immediately teleports in is now perfect is going to spot the grand starall that means that owner going to be moved out of the way of The Equalizer as well not in position as KT they regroup perfect on that flank angle wants that public execution and T1 they do not want to risk it I think that's smart vision of Empire does get Vision as CZ almost just blows up Mega Inferno bomb avoided by everyone that was kind of the saddest Zig old I've ever seen yeah it was not a great one that's just another turret here for T1 so yeah T1 made the right call don't take a bad fight there just simply back away it's only second dragon here for KT rollster it's not sole point like I I can't actually isolate a Target here KT will trade a turret back which is nice it was perfect like being able to spot the grand starle before the uh the icon actually happened on the ground right because otherwise pretty it is actually Earth Wind and Fire though I love that doran's going to get another turret here I don't think there's any way to answer perfect has TP but isn't going to opt into it and so that's just going to be more gold in the rumble's pocket which is pushing him closer to that void staff likely could be a crit Bloom but make hone upset so I hope it's a void staff in this situation especially considering the Mr that's been built up here by his opposition perfect having that Ma online now uh for the side lane matchups where like they did with those turrets last time around if it's KT having to get to the fight second and show up their engages aren't necessarily as robust they're more strong defensively oh is trying to find owner here just puts up the door or the shield and is going to go in Doran not going to overc commit to this one or is he equalizer goes down it's on aity and CZ and now carrier looks for the opportunity gets into that back line the zig explodes the entire bottom Lane is just already dead BD doing a fair bit of work but it is not enough cuz trying to stay alive The Flash does not work and T1 will wipe the floor with KT yeah you know there's there's very rarely when you make a a color point where you're like I don't know if they should ever really be the ones to attack when they don't know what's going on it's very rarely a more picturesque example of something owner and Tera Aon is being taken in live by T1 after this wipe and like I mentioned before yeah PD he stays on the think things for a long time he's very difficult to kill but as they kind of front to back this as as the rest of the team gets peeled apart and I just think that it is not going to work do going to turn up with Baron up minions they do survive for a whole lot longer than they have any right to is now BD is just going to get aled by Faker doesn't quite find the combo as The Equalizer is also a little bit weird when there is a flash up and available carrier just going in because he can I mean car is teaching KT rolster a lesson like with some of these baits he's set up some of these moments where it looks like he's caught he's like no no no no no you're locked in here with me and and it was so face up as well they managed to get it you know second round on blue side D1 just have so many different options and there's no risk really because they have wings you know they're they're sitting here going well yeah know if you want to if you want to try to collapse on us if you kill someone in the side like that doesn't matter can you win a dragon fight against us we we have you know the ability to just rejoin like I you can't win a dragon fight cuz we have Baron buff also like there's just no losing there's another equal as it comes down as dock is going to flash into Faker and just pop like a balloon F just bouncing around his ultimate looking absolutely cool while he does so and T1 they just kill three and they're able to move even further forward perfect has decided that he just wants to try and take whatever they can but I think he's going to be required back home because there is an invasion as T1 look to take down their first inhibitor of the game and look for even more maybe they're just done with this game as Doran is just flashing on top of bdd who just dies oh my God perfect maybe he shouldn't have come home maybe should have actually stayed in the Top Lane because this game is over Nexus turret 1 is going to go down Nexus turret 2 is surely to follow and we yeah he spent a little bit of time outside of the fountain but I think he wants back in please end his misery and T1 will acques that is the game three Victory these were some of the best highlights from today's matchup which moment was your favorite let me know in the comment section below this is op and I'll see you tomorrow take care
